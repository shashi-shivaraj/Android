1) Bite Counter WearOS App

Developed a native application for Google’s WearOS smartwatches,which utilizes Android’s NDK 
API to capture watch’s gyroscope data.
Implemented the patented algorithm of the company to determine the bite count during a meal using the gyroscope data. 

Implemented a client which sends the session data from the smartwatch to a remote server using HTTP protocol if connected to WiFi or forwards the session data to a Mobile client using Bluetooth protocol.

2) Bite Counter Mobile App
Developed an Android application,which utilizes Bluetooth to receive data from the Bite Counter WearOS App of a smartwatch and sends it to a remote server using HTTP protocol.

Both the applications are published at Google Play Store.
