This is a native android application used to capture data from Accelerometer sensor and Gyroscope sensor.
The native libraries are built using ndk-build and the application using Android Studio.
The native libraries can also be built using AOSP source code using the provided vendor setup.

The data from the sensors are stored at:
sdcard/android.sensor.accelerometer.txt
sdcard/android.sensor.gyroscope.txt

Issues:
Need to provide storage permission manually on few devices.
